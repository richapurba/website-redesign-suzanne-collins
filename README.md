# redesign-suzanne-collins-website

This is a website redesign from suzannecollinsbooks.com. I did this simple website redesign just to challenge myself about CSS technology. Through this project, I learnt how to use Git and GitHub, CSS positioning, CSS flex and grid, a little bit of JavaScript, and much more. The funny thing about me before doing this project is whenever I try to do coding practice by doing simple projects, I only use GitHub directly from its <a href="https://github.com">website</a>. I didn't even know about Git.
This is such a crazy challenge that I made, because I've decided that I won't change the whole content from the original website, either the text, color, or the images. I will only change the way it looks, I mean the design using pure CSS. Although I already know how to use Bootstrap, I think that this is a perfect method to upgrade my skill in CSS. Additional note that I will add some text like "See more..." and "Rebuilt by Richa Purba" to watermark my project and take the design into a modern-minimalism look.
